### FeatureModule
---
We are going to create multiple feature modules for every independent feature of our application. Feature modules should only import services from CoreModule. If feature module A needs to import service from feature module B consider moving that service into core.

* In some cases there is a need for services which are shared only by some features and it wouldnâ€™t make much sense to move them into core. In that case we can create special shared feature modules as described later in this post.
